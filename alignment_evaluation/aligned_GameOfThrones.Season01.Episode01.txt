112.639 113.854 WAYMAR_ROYCE Easy, boy.
184.799 186.755 WAYMAR_ROYCE What do you expect? They're savages.
186.880 189.110 WAYMAR_ROYCE One lot steals a goat from another lot,
189.240 191.515 WAYMAR_ROYCE before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces.
191.639 193.948 WILL I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.
194.080 196.196 WILL I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.
197.177 198.389 WAYMAR_ROYCE How close did you get?
198.480 199.900 WILL Close as any man would.
199.900 201.756 GARED We should head back to the Wall.
204.280 205.679 WAYMAR_ROYCE Do the dead frighten you?
205.840 207.876 GARED Our orders were to track the wildlings.
207.999 211.036 GARED We tracked them. They won‘t trouble us no more.
211.159 213.514 WAYMAR_ROYCE You don‘t think he'll ask us how they died?
215.679 217.397 WAYMAR_ROYCE Get back on your horse.
221.879 224.313 WILL Whatever did it to them could do it to us.
224.400 225.958 WILL They even killed the children.
226.840 228.751 WAYMAR_ROYCE It's a good thing we're not children.
230.079 232.798 WAYMAR_ROYCE You want to run away south, run away.
232.920 235.718 WAYMAR_ROYCE Of course, they will behead you as a deserter.
235.840 237.831 WAYMAR_ROYCE If I don't catch you ﬁrst.
240.120 242.350 WAYMAR_ROYCE Get back on your horse.
242.480 244.675 WAYMAR_ROYCE I won't say it again.
274.519 276.953 WAYMAR_ROYCE Your dead men seem to have moved mp.
277.600 279.192 WILL They were here.
282.440 284.032 GARED See where they went.

668.559 670.072 CATELYN_STARK Ned.

800.000 801.558 JON_SNOW You did well.
828.600 830.033 EDDARD_STARK You understand why I did it?
830.160 831.957 BRAN_STARK Jon said he was a deserter.
832.080 834.514 EDDARD_STARK But do you understand why I had to kill him?
834.639 836.152 BRAN_STARK "Our way is the old way"?
837.759 841.274 EDDARD_STARK The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
842.279 844.554 BRAN_STARK Is it true he saw the white walkers?
846.480 849.358 EDDARD_STARK The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
850.440 851.919 BRAN_STARK So he was lying?
856.199 858.429 EDDARD_STARK A madman sees what he sees.
883.320 885.151 JON_SNOW What is it?
887.480 889.038 THEON_GREYJOY Mountain lion?
890.400 892.595 EDDARD_STARK There are no mountain lions in these woods.
936.880 938.598 THEON_GREYJOY It's a freak
939.920 941.148 EDDARD_STARK It's a direwolf.
950.039 952.189 EDDARD_STARK Tough old beast.
954.399 956.390 ROBB_STARK There are no direwolves south of the Wall.
957.239 958.467 JON_SNOW Now there are ﬁve.
960.040 961.632 JON_SNOW You want to hold it?
965.999 967.432 BRAN_STARK Where will they go?
967.560 969.198 BRAN_STARK Their mother's dead.
969.319 970.798 RODRIK_CASSEL They don't belong down here.
970.920 974.549 EDDARD_STARK Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.
974.679 976.249 THEON_GREYJOY Right. Give it here.

980.444 981.237 BRAN_STARK Please, Fatherl
981.359 983.077 EDDARD_STARK I'm sorry, Bran.
983.199 984.188 JON_SNOW Lord Stark?
988.680 990.671 JON_SNOW One for each of the Stark children.
991.396 993.188 JON_SNOW The direwolf is the sigil of your house.
994.519 996.635 JON_SNOW They were meant to have them.
1001.680 1003.750 EDDARD_STARK You will train them yourselves.
1003.880 1005.677 EDDARD_STARK You will feed them yourselves.
1005.799 1008.552 EDDARD_STARK And ifthey die, you will bury them yourselves.
1016.839 1018.477 BRAN_STARK What about you?
1019.319 1020.911 JON_SNOW I'm not a Stark.
1021.040 1023.031 JON_SNOW Get on.
1032.680 1034.079 ROBB_STARK What is it?
1038.119 1041.475 THEON_GREYJOY The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow.
1099.200 1102.237 JAIME_LANNISTER As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you...
1103.400 1105.311 JAIME_LANNISTER you worry too much.
1105.440 1106.743 JAIME_LANNISTER It's starting to show.
1106.743 1108.671 CERSEI_LANNISTER And you never worry about anything.
1109.920 1113.674 CERSEI_LANNISTER When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock.
1113.800 1117.952 CERSEI_LANNISTER 100-foot drop into the water... you were never afraid.
1118.079 1120.639 JAIME_LANNISTER There was nothing to be afraid of until you told Father.
1120.719 1124.189 JAIME_LANNISTER 'We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools."
1126.479 1128.493 CERSEI_LANNISTER What if Jon Arryn told someone?
1128.493 1129.915 JAIME_LANNISTER But who would he tell?
1131.200 1132.269 CERSEI_LANNISTER My husband.
1132.400 1135.995 JAIME_LANNISTER If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now.
1137.519 1140.511 JAIME_LANNISTER Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him.
1141.359 1143.077 JAIME_LANNISTER And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King,
1143.240 1146.630 JAIME_LANNISTER someone to do his job while he's off flicking boars and hunting whores.
1146.759 1148.397 JAIME_LANNISTER Or is it the other way around?
1149.880 1152.110 JAIME_LANNISTER And life will go on.
1152.240 1154.708 CERSEI_LANNISTER You should be the Hand of the King.
1155.520 1157.272 JAIME_LANNISTER That's an honour l n do without.
1157.399 1158.957 JAIME_LANNISTER Their days are too long,
1159.079 1160.717 JAIME_LANNISTER their lives are too short.
1198.599 1199.748 CATELYN_STARK All these years,
1199.919 1202.911 CATELYN_STARK and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
1204.680 1206.238 EDDARD_STARK You have ﬁve northern children.
1207.440 1209.670 EDDARD_STARK You're not an outsider.
1209.800 1212.155 CATELYN_STARK I wonder ifthe old gods agree.
1213.400 1215.152 EDDARD_STARK It's your gods with all the rules.
1221.640 1223.915 CATELYN_STARK I am so sorry, my love.
1224.999 1225.740 EDDARD_STARK Tell me.
1225.740 1228.435 CATELYN_STARK There was a raven from King's Landing.
1230.479 1231.958 CATELYN_STARK Jon Arryn is dead.
1232.079 1234.513 CATELYN_STARK A fever took him.
1237.279 1239.349 CATELYN_STARK I know he was like a father to you.
1242.360 1243.639 EDDARD_STARK Your sister, the boy?
1243.639 1245.238 CATELYN_STARK They both have their health,
1245.359 1247.270 CATELYN_STARK gods be good.
1257.120 1258.394 CATELYN_STARK The raven brought more news.
1260.479 1262.709 CATELYN_STARK The king rides for Winterfell...
1263.719 1266.392 CATELYN_STARK with the queen and all the rest of them.
1267.280 1269.510 EDDARD_STARK If he's coming this far north...
1271.120 1272.997 EDDARD_STARK there's only one thing he's after.
1273.079 1276.310 CATELYN_STARK You n always say no, Ned.
1284.320 1287.869 CATELYN_STARK We'll need plenty of ndles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.
1288.000 1289.769 CATELYN_STARK I'm told he reads all night.
1289.769 1291.595 MAESTER_LUWIN I'm told he drinl<s all night.
1291.719 1294.756 CATELYN_STARK How much could he possibly drink? A man of his...
1294.879 1296.358 CATELYN_STARK stature?
1296.479 1299.232 MAESTER_LUWIN We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar.
1299.359 1300.508 MAESTER_LUWIN Perhaps we'll ﬁnd out.
1300.639 1302.391 CATELYN_STARK In any case, ndles.
1308.280 1311.078 JON_SNOW Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king?
1311.200 1313.839 THEON_GREYJOY It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's a sleek bit of mink
1313.959 1315.915 ROBB_STARK I hear the prince is a right royal prick
1316.039 1319.349 THEON_GREYJOY Think of all those southem girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick
1321.200 1323.236 ROBB_STARK Go on, Tommy, shear him good.
1323.360 1325.555 ROBB_STARK He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.
1361.871 1363.599 CATELYN_STARK Gods, but they grow fast.
1365.959 1367.392 BRAN_STARK Brandonl
1367.519 1370.397 CATELYN_STARK I saw the king. He's got hundreds of people.
1373.599 1376.432 BRAN_STARK But he's coming right now, down our road.
1383.160 1385.469 CATELYN_STARK I want you to promise me,
1385.599 1387.157 CATELYN_STARK no more climbing.
1391.839 1392.908 BRAN_STARK I promise.
1395.040 1397.197 CATELYN_STARK Do you know what?
1397.197 1397.952 BRAN_STARK What?
1398.079 1400.195 CATELYN_STARK You always look at your feet before you lie.
1402.280 1403.952 CATELYN_STARK Run and ﬁnd your father.
1404.079 1406.035 CATELYN_STARK Tell him the king is close.
1448.599 1451.875 CATELYN_STARK Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?
1461.759 1463.388 CATELYN_STARK HEY. NW. NW. he!-

1576.519 1579.829 ROBERT_BARATHEON Nine years... Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
1579.959 1583.349 EDDARD_STARK Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.
1587.119 1588.336 ARYA_STARK Where's the Imp?
1588.336 1589.553 SANSA_STARK Will you shut up?
1589.679 1591.112 ROBERT_BARATHEON Who have we here?
1592.440 1593.714 ROBERT_BARATHEON You must be Robb.
1596.560 1598.596 ROBERT_BARATHEON My, you're a pretty one.
1599.959 1601.790 ROBERT_BARATHEON Your name is?
1601.879 1603.198 ARYA_STARK Arya.
1604.360 1606.828 ROBERT_BARATHEON Oh, show us your muscles.
1608.119 1610.314 ROBERT_BARATHEON You'll be a soldier.
1613.079 1615.388 ARYA_STARK That's Jaime Lannister, the queen's twin brother.
1615.520 1617.556 SANSA_STARK Would you please shut up?
1626.759 1627.714 EDDARD_STARK My queen.
1628.920 1630.433 CATELYN_STARK My queen.
1630.599 1632.510 ROBERT_BARATHEON Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
1632.599 1634.351 CERSEI_LANNISTER We've been riding for a month, my love.
1634.839 1636.397 CERSEI_LANNISTER Surely the dead n wait.
1636.519 1638.316 ROBERT_BARATHEON Ned.
1647.599 1648.748 ARYA_STARK Where's the Imp?
1652.120 1654.031 CERSEI_LANNISTER Where is our brother?
1654.160 1655.718 CERSEI_LANNISTER Go and ﬁnd the little beast.
1658.120 1659.712 EDDARD_STARK Tell me about Jon Arryn.
1660.920 1663.036 ROBERT_BARATHEON One minute he was ﬁne and then...
1664.160 1666.833 ROBERT_BARATHEON burned right through him, whatever it was.
1667.959 1669.870 ROBERT_BARATHEON I loved that man.
1670.000 1671.274 EDDARD_STARK We both did.
1671.399 1675.551 ROBERT_BARATHEON He never had to teach you much, but me? You remember me at 16?
1676.370 1677.432 ROBERT_BARATHEON All I wanted to do
1677.560 1680.074 ROBERT_BARATHEON was crack skulls and fuck girls.
1680.200 1682.693 ROBERT_BARATHEON He showed me what was what.
1682.693 1683.192 EDDARD_STARK Aye.
1683.320 1685.834 ROBERT_BARATHEON Don't look at me like that. It's not his fault I didn't listen.
1690.200 1692.156 ROBERT_BARATHEON I need you, Ned,
1692.280 1695.795 ROBERT_BARATHEON down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody.
1697.599 1699.317 ROBERT_BARATHEON Lord Eddard Stark...
1700.239 1702.548 ROBERT_BARATHEON I would name you the Hand of the King.
1706.879 1708.915 EDDARD_STARK I'm not worthy of the honour.
1709.040 1710.393 ROBERT_BARATHEON I'm not trying to honour you.
1710.519 1712.111 ROBERT_BARATHEON I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom
1712.239 1715.834 ROBERT_BARATHEON while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave.
1715.919 1717.716 ROBERT_BARATHEON Damn it, Ned, stand up.
1719.200 1721.077 ROBERT_BARATHEON You helped me win the Iron Throne,
1721.200 1723.760 ROBERT_BARATHEON now help me keep the damn thing.
1723.920 1726.195 ROBERT_BARATHEON We were meant to rule together.
1726.319 1729.994 ROBERT_BARATHEON If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood.
1730.920 1732.399 ROBERT_BARATHEON Well, it's not too late.
1734.040 1735.632 ROBERT_BARATHEON I have a son, you have a daughter.
1737.399 1738.957 ROBERT_BARATHEON We'll join our houses.
1763.119 1765.952 TYRION_LANNISTER It is true what they say about the northern girls.
1773.879 1776.109 ROS Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?
1776.239 1777.797 TYRION_LANNISTER I did hear something about that.
1777.920 1779.990 ROS And the queen and her twin brother.
1780.119 1783.031 ROS They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
1783.120 1784.951 TYRION_LANNISTER And the other brother?
1785.040 1786.657 ROS The queen has two brothers?
1786.657 1788.112 TYRION_LANNISTER There's the pretty one...
1789.320 1790.912 TYRION_LANNISTER and there's the clever one.
1793.719 1795.869 ROS I hear they II him the Imp.
1796.040 1797.712 TYRION_LANNISTER I hear he hates that nickname.
1797.879 1801.110 ROS Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.
1801.239 1803.355 ROS I hear he's a drunken little Iecher,
1803.479 1805.868 ROS prone to all manner of perversions.

1814.970 1815.393 TYRION_LANNISTER Ohl
1818.200 1820.165 TYRION_LANNISTER The gods gave me one blessing.
1825.440 1826.938 JAIME_LANNISTER Don't get up.
1826.938 1827.874 ROS My lord.
1828.000 1831.515 TYRION_LANNISTER Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?
1831.640 1833.596 JAIME_LANNISTER You have much to teach me, no doubt,
1833.719 1836.711 JAIME_LANNISTER but our sister craves your attention.
1837.440 1839.351 TYRION_LANNISTER She has odd cravings, our sister.
1839.479 1841.435 JAIME_LANNISTER A family trait.

1848.759 1851.990 TYRION_LANNISTER And this is the ﬁrst of many courses.
1852.079 1854.195 JAIME_LANNISTER I thought you might say that.
1854.320 1856.834 JAIME_LANNISTER But since we're short on time...
1856.959 1858.187 JAIME_LANNISTER Come on, girls.

1879.719 1882.313 ROBERT_BARATHEON Did you have to bury her in a place like this?
1884.119 1886.235 ROBERT_BARATHEON She should be on a hill somewhere
1886.399 1888.594 ROBERT_BARATHEON with the sun and the clouds above her.
1888.719 1890.675 EDDARD_STARK She was my sister.
1890.800 1892.392 EDDARD_STARK This is where she belongs.
1893.520 1895.750 ROBERT_BARATHEON She belonged with me.
1900.999 1904.071 ROBERT_BARATHEON In my dreams, I kill him every night.
1905.599 1909.672 EDDARD_STARK It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.

1940.279 1942.395 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Go on, feel the fabric.
1950.160 1951.912 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Isn't he a gracious host?
1955.160 1958.675 DAENERYS_TARGARYEN We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.
1958.799 1960.596 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Illyrio's no fool.
1960.719 1962.437 VISERYS_TARGARYEN He knows I won't forget my ﬁiends
1962.560 1964.710 VISERYS_TARGARYEN when I come into my throne.
1968.879 1970.551 VISERYS_TARGARYEN You still slouch.
1974.760 1976.955 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Let them see.
1979.640 1982.279 VISERYS_TARGARYEN You have a woman's body now.
1999.439 2001.350 VISERYS_TARGARYEN I need you to be perfect today.
2003.799 2005.118 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Can you do that for me?
2008.520 2010.988 VISERYS_TARGARYEN You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?
2012.879 2013.868 DAENERYS_TARGARYEN No.
2020.719 2023.187 VISERYS_TARGARYEN When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister,
2023.320 2025.197 VISERYS_TARGARYEN they will say it began today.
2047.959 2049.517 MAID It's too hot, my lady.
2069.959 2071.756 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Where is he?
2071.919 2074.638 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
2087.439 2091.318 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS Athchomar chomaloaan, Khal vezhven.
2091.439 2093.270 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS May I present my honoured guests?
2093.399 2096.755 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS Viserys of House Targaryen,
2096.919 2098.352 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS the third of his name,
2098.439 2101.715 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,
2101.840 2103.068 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS and his sister,
2103.199 2105.952 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS Daenerys of House Targaryen.
2108.880 2111.155 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Do you see how long his hair is?
2111.320 2113.959 VISERYS_TARGARYEN When Dothraki are defeated in combat
2114.080 2117.550 VISERYS_TARGARYEN they cut off their braid so the whole world n see their shame.
2117.639 2121.348 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Khal Drogo has never been defeated.
2122.719 2126.428 VISERYS_TARGARYEN He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the ﬁnest killers alive.
2127.800 2129.836 VISERYS_TARGARYEN And you will be his queen.
2130.600 2132.352 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS Come forward, my dear.
2170.840 2171.955 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Where is he going?
2172.080 2173.055 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS The ceremony is over.
2173.055 2174.640 VISERYS_TARGARYEN But he... But he didn't say anything.
2174.800 2175.869 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Did he like her?
2175.999 2179.594 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS Trust me, Your Grace, if he didn't like her, we'd know.
2182.599 2184.715 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS It won't be long now.
2184.840 2188.355 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS Soon you will cross the narrow sea and take back your father's throne.
2189.519 2193.228 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS The people drink secret toasts to your health.
2193.320 2195.675 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS They cry out for their true king.
2199.079 2200.910 VISERYS_TARGARYEN When will they be married?
2200.999 2204.389 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
2204.560 2206.710 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Is it true they lie with their horses?
2207.439 2209.589 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.
2209.720 2211.756 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Do you take me for a fool?
2211.880 2213.518 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS I take you for a king.
2213.639 2216.631 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS Kings lack the ution of common men.
2216.760 2218.398 ILLYRIO_MOPATIS My apologies if I've given offence.
2218.519 2221.033 VISERYS_TARGARYEN I know how to play a man like Drogo.
2221.120 2223.839 VISERYS_TARGARYEN I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
2224.679 2226.670 DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I don't want to be his queen.
2231.560 2232.834 DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I want to go home.
2233.519 2234.747 VISERYS_TARGARYEN Sodo I.
2235.880 2238.075 VISERYS_TARGARYEN I want us both to go home,
2238.239 2240.309 VISERYS_TARGARYEN but they took it from us.
2240.439 2242.191 VISERYS_TARGARYEN So tell me, sweet sister,
2242.279 2243.871 VISERYS_TARGARYEN how do we go home?
2246.480 2247.595 DAENERYS_TARGARYEN I don't know.
2247.719 2249.869 VISERYS_TARGARYEN We go home with an army.
2251.880 2254.075 VISERYS_TARGARYEN With Khal Drogo's army.
2255.239 2258.117 VISERYS_TARGARYEN I would let his whole tribe fuck you,
2258.239 2261.197 VISERYS_TARGARYEN all 40,000 men and their horses too,
2261.360 2262.918 VISERYS_TARGARYEN if that's what it took.
2279.560 2281.915 SANSA_STARK Do you think Joffrey will like me?
2282.039 2284.155 SANSA_STARK What if he thinks I'm ugly?
2284.280 2287.556 CATELYN_STARK Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
2290.120 2291.394 SANSA_STARK He's so handsome.
2292.520 2295.114 SANSA_STARK When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait?
2295.239 2298.197 CATELYN_STARK Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.
2298.320 2299.912 SANSA_STARK Why would he say no?
2300.040 2302.838 SANSA_STARK He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
2302.959 2304.915 CATELYN_STARK He'd have to leave home.
2306.159 2308.434 CATELYN_STARK He'd have to leave me.
2309.399 2311.435 CATELYN_STARK And so would you.
2311.559 2313.789 SANSA_STARK You left your home to come here.
2313.919 2315.591 SANSA_STARK And I'd be queen someday.
2317.479 2318.958 SANSA_STARK Please make Father say yesl
2319.080 2319.755 CATELYN_STARK Sansa...
2319.755 2320.798 SANSA_STARK Please, pleasel
2320.919 2323.672 SANSA_STARK It's the only thing I ever wanted.
2336.999 2339.035 SANSA_STARK Fill that upl Boys, Rodrik come on.
2339.199 2341.155 SANSA_STARK Come onl
2341.280 2343.874 SANSA_STARK Come here, you little beautyl
2359.080 2360.308 BENJEN_STARK Is he dead yet?
2365.560 2366.595 JON_SNOW Uncle Benjen.
2369.479 2370.628 BENJEN_STARK You got bigger.
2371.959 2373.472 BENJEN_STARK Rode all day.
2373.559 2376.073 BENJEN_STARK Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.
2376.199 2377.427 BENJEN_STARK Why aren't you at the feast?
2377.600 2380.239 JON_SNOW Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family
2380.320 2382.151 JON_SNOW to seat a bastard in their midst.
2382.999 2385.274 BENJEN_STARK Well, you're always welcome on the Wall.
2385.399 2387.276 BENJEN_STARK No bastard was ever refused a seat there.
2387.399 2388.991 JON_SNOW So take me with you when you go back
2389.159 2389.703 BENJEN_STARK Jon...
2389.703 2391.878 JON_SNOW Father will let me if you ask him.
2392.039 2393.711 JON_SNOW I know he will.
2396.360 2398.351 BENJEN_STARK The Wall isn't going anywhere.
2398.439 2401.033 JON_SNOW I'm ready to swear your oath.
2401.159 2404.151 BENJEN_STARK You don't understand what you'd be giving up.
2404.239 2406.116 BENJEN_STARK We have no families.
2406.199 2408.356 BENJEN_STARK None of us will ever father sons.
2408.356 2409.794 JON_SNOW I don't re about that.
2409.919 2412.752 BENJEN_STARK You might, if you knew what it meant.
2415.959 2418.348 BENJEN_STARK I'd better get inside,
2418.480 2420.630 BENJEN_STARK rescue your father from his guests.
2423.560 2425.516 BENJEN_STARK We'll talk later.
2433.639 2435.834 TYRION_LANNISTER Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.
2438.719 2440.914 JON_SNOW What are you doing back there?
2441.080 2443.196 TYRION_LANNISTER Preparing for a night with your family.
2448.200 2450.031 TYRION_LANNISTER I've always wanted to see the Wall.
2450.159 2451.877 JON_SNOW You're Tyr'ion Lannister,
2451.999 2453.432 JON_SNOW the queen's brother?
2453.600 2455.158 TYRION_LANNISTER My greatest accomplishment.
2456.679 2459.193 TYRION_LANNISTER And you, you're Ned Starks bastard, aren't you?
2462.560 2464.596 TYRION_LANNISTER Did I offend you? Sorry.
2466.639 2469.028 TYRION_LANNISTER You are the bastard, though.
2470.280 2472.475 JON_SNOW Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
2473.679 2476.193 TYRION_LANNISTER And Lady Stark is not your mother,
2476.320 2479.198 TYRION_LANNISTER making you...the bastard.
2480.679 2483.147 TYRION_LANNISTER Let me give you some advice, bastard.
2484.320 2485.992 TYRION_LANNISTER Never forget what you are.
2486.120 2488.395 TYRION_LANNISTER The rest of the world will not.
2488.520 2489.999 TYRION_LANNISTER Wear it like armour...
2490.759 2492.989 TYRION_LANNISTER and it n never be used to hurt you.
2494.560 2497.154 JON_SNOW What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
2499.479 2501.868 TYRION_LANNISTER All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.
2522.639 2524.197 BENJEN_STARK You at a
2525.120 2526.758 BENJEN_STARK it's like a bear in a trap.
2528.680 2530.159 EDDARD_STARK The boy I beheaded...
2531.479 2532.580 EDDARD_STARK did you know him?
2532.580 2534.232 BENJEN_STARK Of course I did. Just a lad.
2535.399 2537.390 BENJEN_STARK But he was tough, Ned,
2537.480 2538.674 BENJEN_STARK a true ranger.
2540.360 2542.078 EDDARD_STARK He was talking madness.
2543.199 2544.917 EDDARD_STARK Said the walkers slaughtered his ﬁiends.
2545.040 2547.190 BENJEN_STARK The two he was with are still missing.
2548.840 2552.116 EDDARD_STARK Hmph. A wildling ambush.
2553.080 2554.115 BENJEN_STARK Maybe.
2555.359 2557.793 BENJEN_STARK Direwolves south of the Wall,
2557.919 2560.035 BENJEN_STARK talk of the walkers,
2560.159 2562.593 BENJEN_STARK and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.
2563.759 2565.511 BENJEN_STARK Winter is coming.
2567.120 2568.792 EDDARD_STARK Winter is coming.
2570.399 2572.010 ROBB_STARK Uncle Benjen.
2572.010 2573.118 BENJEN_STARK Robb boy.
2573.240 2574.047 BENJEN_STARK How are you?
2574.047 2574.639 ROBB_STARK I'm good.
2577.960 2580.599 CATELYN_STARK Is this your ﬁrst time in the North, Your Grace?
2580.719 2583.392 CERSEI_LANNISTER Yes. Lover country.
2586.999 2590.196 CATELYN_STARK I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.
2591.439 2595.637 CATELYN_STARK I remember how red I was when Ned brought me up here for the ﬁrst time.
2597.800 2599.279 CERSEI_LANNISTER Hello, little dove.
2600.240 2602.310 CERSEI_LANNISTER But you are a beauty.
2602.440 2603.433 CERSEI_LANNISTER How old are you?
2603.433 2604.635 SANSA_STARK Thirteen, Your Grace.
2604.760 2607.228 CERSEI_LANNISTER You're tall. Still growing?
2607.399 2609.117 SANSA_STARK I think so, Your Grace.
2609.240 2611.276 CERSEI_LANNISTER And have you bled yet?
2616.199 2617.598 SANSA_STARK No, Your Grace.
2619.039 2620.597 CERSEI_LANNISTER Your dress, did you make it?
2622.320 2625.437 CERSEI_LANNISTER Such talent. You must make something for me.
2627.280 2630.192 CERSEI_LANNISTER I hear we might share a grandchild someday.
2631.199 2632.314 CATELYN_STARK I hear the same.
2632.439 2634.555 CERSEI_LANNISTER Your daughter will do well in the pital.
2634.679 2637.876 CERSEI_LANNISTER Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.
2654.199 2654.924 EDDARD_STARK Your pardon.
2654.924 2656.713 JAIME_LANNISTER I hear we might be neighbours soon.
2656.840 2657.818 JAIME_LANNISTER I hope it's true.
2657.818 2660.116 EDDARD_STARK Yes, the king has honoured me with his offer.
2660.280 2663.352 JAIME_LANNISTER I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title, if you accept.
2663.480 2665.471 JAIME_LANNISTER It would be good to have you on the ﬁeld.
2665.600 2667.830 JAIME_LANNISTER The competition has become a bit stale.
2667.999 2669.850 EDDARD_STARK I don't ﬁght in tournaments.
2669.850 2670.149 JAIME_LANNISTER No?
2670.280 2671.713 JAIME_LANNISTER Getting a little old for it?
2673.599 2675.555 EDDARD_STARK I don't ﬁght in tournaments
2675.719 2677.994 EDDARD_STARK because when I ﬁght a man for real,
2678.120 2679.792 EDDARD_STARK I don't want him to know what I n do.
2681.999 2683.318 JAIME_LANNISTER Well said.
2685.467 2685.913 JAIME_LANNISTER Aryal
2688.159 2689.797 JAIME_LANNISTER It's not funnyl
2689.880 2692.440 JAIME_LANNISTER She always does this.
2692.560 2694.869 JAIME_LANNISTER This was my favourite dress and she ruined it.
2694.999 2697.354 SANSA_STARK She always does it and it's not funnyl
2697.480 2699.232 ROBB_STARK Time for bed.
2709.880 2711.472 EDDARD_STARK I'm a Northman.
2713.080 2717.437 EDDARD_STARK I belong here with you, not down south in that rats' nest they II a pital.
2718.439 2721.078 CATELYN_STARK I won't let him take you.
2722.520 2725.034 EDDARD_STARK The king takes what he wants.
2725.159 2727.309 EDDARD_STARK That's why he's king.
2728.320 2731.869 CATELYN_STARK I'll say, "Listen, fat man."
