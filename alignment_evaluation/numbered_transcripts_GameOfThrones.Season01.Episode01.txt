WAYMAR_ROYCE : What do you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they're ripping each other to pieces.

1
WILL : I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I've never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.

2
WAYMAR_ROYCE : How close did you get?

3
WILL : Close as any man would.

4
GARED : We should head back to the wall.

5
WAYMAR_ROYCE : Do the dead frighten you?

6
GARED : Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won't trouble us no more.

7
WAYMAR_ROYCE : You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.

8
WILL : Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.

9
WAYMAR_ROYCE : It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter ... if I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again.

10
WAYMAR_ROYCE : Your dead men seem to have moved camp.

11
WILL : They were here.

12
GARED : See where they went.

13
WAYMAR_ROYCE : What is it?

14
GARED : It's ...

15
JON_SNOW : Go on. Father's watching.

16
JON_SNOW : And your mother.

17
SEPTA_MORDANE : Fine work, as always. Well done.

18
SANSA_STARK : Thank you.

19
SEPTA_MORDANE : I love the detail that you've managed to get in this corners. Quite beautiful ... the stitching ...

20
EDDARD_STARK : And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.

21
JON_SNOW : Don't think too much, Bran.

22
ROBB_STARK : Relax your bow arm.

23
ROBB_STARK : Quick, Bran, faster!

24
RODRIK_CASSEL : Lord Stark. My lady. A guardsman just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.

25
EDDARD_STARK : Get the lads to saddle their horses.

26
CATELYN_STARK : Do you have to?

27
EDDARD_STARK : He swore an oath, Cat.

28
RODRIK_CASSEL : The law is law, my lady.

29
EDDARD_STARK : Tell Bran he's coming, too.

30
CATELYN_STARK : Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.

31
EDDARD_STARK : He won't be a boy forever. And winter is coming.

32
ROBB_STARK : Lad, go run back and get the rest.

33
WILL : White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them.

34
WILL : I know I broke my oath. And I know I'm a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I'm no coward. Tell them I'm sorry.

35
WILL : Forgive me, lord.

36
EDDARD_STARK : In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name ...

37
JON_SNOW : Don't look away.

38
EDDARD_STARK : King of the Andals and the First Men...

39
JON_SNOW : Father will know if you do.

40
EDDARD_STARK : Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.

41
JON_SNOW : You did well.

42
EDDARD_STARK : You understand why I did it?

43
BRAN_STARK : Jon said he was a deserter.

44
EDDARD_STARK : But do you understand why I had to kill him?

45
BRAN_STARK : Our way is the old way?

46
EDDARD_STARK : The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.

47
BRAN_STARK : Is it true he saw the White Walkers?

48
EDDARD_STARK : The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.

49
BRAN_STARK : So he was lying?

50
EDDARD_STARK : A madman sees what he sees.

51
JON_SNOW : What is it?

52
THEON_GREYJOY : Mountain lion?

53
EDDARD_STARK : There are no mountain lions in these woods.

54
THEON_GREYJOY : It's a freak.

55
EDDARD_STARK : It's a direwolf.

56
EDDARD_STARK : Tough old beast.

57
ROBB_STARK : There are no direwolves south of the Wall.

58
JON_SNOW : Now there are five.

59
JON_SNOW : You want to hold it?

60
BRAN_STARK : Where will they go? Their mother's dead.

61
RODRIK_CASSEL : They don't belong down here.

62
EDDARD_STARK : Better a quick death. They won't last without their mother.

63
THEON_GREYJOY : Right. Give it here.

64
BRAN_STARK : No!

65
ROBB_STARK : Put away your blade.

66
THEON_GREYJOY : I take orders from your father, not you.

67
BRAN_STARK : Please, father!

68
EDDARD_STARK : I'm sorry, Bran.

69
JON_SNOW : Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.

70
EDDARD_STARK : You will train them yourselves. You will feed them yourselves. And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.

71
BRAN_STARK : What about you?

72
JON_SNOW : I'm not a Stark. Get on.

73
ROBB_STARK : What is it?

74
THEON_GREYJOY : The runt of the litter. That one's yours, Snow.

75
JAIME_LANNISTER : As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you. You worry too much. It's starting to show.

76
CERSEI_LANNISTER : And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock. A hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid.

77
JAIME_LANNISTER : There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. We're Lannisters. Lannisters don't act like fools.

78
CERSEI_LANNISTER : What if Jon Arryn told someone?

79
JAIME_LANNISTER : But who would he tell?

80
CERSEI_LANNISTER : My husband.

81
JAIME_LANNISTER : If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.

82
CERSEI_LANNISTER : You should be the Hand of the king.

83
JAIME_LANNISTER : That's an honor I can do without. Their days are too long, their lives are too short.

84
CATELYN_STARK : All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.

85
EDDARD_STARK : You have five northern children. You're not an outsider.

86
CATELYN_STARK : I wonder if the old gods agree.

87
EDDARD_STARK : It's your gods with all the rules.

88
CATELYN_STARK : I am so sorry, my love.

89
EDDARD_STARK : Tell me.

90
CATELYN_STARK : There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.

91
EDDARD_STARK : Your sister. The boy ...

92
CATELYN_STARK : They both have their health. Gods be good. The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.

93
EDDARD_STARK : If he's coming this far North, there's only one thing he's after.

94
CATELYN_STARK : You can always say no, Ned.

95
CATELYN_STARK : We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night.

96
MAESTER_LUWIN : I'm told he drinks all night.

97
CATELYN_STARK : How much could he possibly drink? A man of his ... stature.

98
MAESTER_LUWIN : We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out.

99
CATELYN_STARK : In any case, candles.

100
JON_SNOW : Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?

101
THEON_GREYJOY : It's for the queen, I bet. I hear she's sleek bit of mink?

102
ROBB_STARK : I hear the prince is a right royal prick.

103
THEON_GREYJOY : Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.

104
ROBB_STARK : Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.

105
CATELYN_STARK : Gods, but they grow fast. Brandon!

106
BRAN_STARK : I saw the king! He's got hundreds of people!

107
CATELYN_STARK : How many times have I told you: No climbing!

108
BRAN_STARK : But he's coming right now! Down our road!

109
CATELYN_STARK : I want you to promise me: No more climbing.

110
BRAN_STARK : I promise.

111
CATELYN_STARK : Do you know what?

112
BRAN_STARK : What?

113
CATELYN_STARK : You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.

114
CATELYN_STARK : Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister?

115
EDDARD_STARK : Hey, hey, hey, hey. What are you doing with that on? Go on.

116
ARYA_STARK : Move!

117
EDDARD_STARK : Your Grace.

118
ROBERT_BARATHEON : You've got fat.

119
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Cat!

120
CATELYN_STARK : Your Grace.

121
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Nine years. Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been?

122
EDDARD_STARK : Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours.

123
ARYA_STARK : Where's the Imp?

124
SANSA_STARK : Will you shut up?

125
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Who have we here? You must be Robb. My, you're a pretty one. Your name is?

126
ARYA_STARK : Arya.

127
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Ooh. Show us your muscles. You'll be a soldier.

128
ARYA_STARK : That's Jaime Lannister. The queen's twin brother.

129
SANSA_STARK : Would you please shut up.

130
EDDARD_STARK : My queen.

131
CATELYN_STARK : My queen.

132
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.

133
CERSEI_LANNISTER : We've been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait.

134
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Ned.

135
ARYA_STARK : Where's the Imp?

136
CERSEI_LANNISTER : Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.

137
EDDARD_STARK : Tell me about Jon Arryn.

138
ROBERT_BARATHEON : One minute he was fine, and then ... Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man.

139
EDDARD_STARK : We both did.

140
ROBERT_BARATHEON : He never had to teach you much, but me ... You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what.

141
EDDARD_STARK : Aye.

142
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Don't look at me like that. Not his fault I didn't listen. I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you're no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king.

143
EDDARD_STARK : I'm not worthy of the honor.

144
ROBERT_BARATHEON : I'm not trying to honor you. I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it's not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We'll join our Houses.

145
TYRION_LANNISTER : Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.

146
ROS : Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?

147
TYRION_LANNISTER : I did hear something about that.

148
ROS : And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

149
TYRION_LANNISTER : And the other brother?

150
ROS : The queen has two brothers?

151
TYRION_LANNISTER : There's the pretty one. And there's the clever one.

152
ROS : I hear they call him the Imp.

153
TYRION_LANNISTER : I hear he hates that nickname.

154
ROS : Oh? I hear he's more than earned it. I hear he's a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.

155
TYRION_LANNISTER : Clever girl.

156
ROS : We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.

157
TYRION_LANNISTER : Have you?

158
TYRION_LANNISTER : The gods gave me one blessing.

159
JAIME_LANNISTER : Don't get up.

160
ROS : M'lord.

161
TYRION_LANNISTER : Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?

162
JAIME_LANNISTER : You've much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention.

163
TYRION_LANNISTER : She has odd cravings, our sister.

164
JAIME_LANNISTER : A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don't leave me alone with these people.

165
TYRION_LANNISTER : I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses.

166
JAIME_LANNISTER : I thought you might say that. But since we're short on time, Come on, girls. See you at sundown.

167
TYRION_LANNISTER : Close the door!

168
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.

169
EDDARD_STARK : She was my sister. This is where she belongs.

170
ROBERT_BARATHEON : She belonged with me. In my dreams, I kill him every night.

171
EDDARD_STARK : It's done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone.

172
ROBERT_BARATHEON : Not all of them.

173
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : Daenerys!

174
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : Daenerys! There's our bride to be! Look - a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Go on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn't he a gracious host?

175
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN : We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.

176
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. You have a woman's body now. I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you?

177
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN : No.

178
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.

179
MAID : It's too hot, my lady.

180
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : Where is he?

181
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.

182
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen.

183
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen.

184
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : Come forward, my dear.

185
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : Where's he going?

186
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : The ceremony is over.

187
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : But he didn't say anything. Did he like her?

188
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn't like her, we'd know.

189
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : It won't be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father's throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.

190
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : When will they be married?

191
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.

192
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : Is it true they lie with their horses?

193
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.

194
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : Do you take me for a fool?

195
ILLYRIO_MOPATIS : I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I've given offense.

196
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.

197
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN : I don't want to be his queen. I want to go home.

198
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?

199
DAENERYS_TARGARYEN : I don't know.

200
VISERYS_TARGARYEN : We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.

201
SANSA_STARK : Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?

202
CATELYN_STARK : Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.

203
SANSA_STARK : He's so handsome.

204
SANSA_STARK : When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?

205
CATELYN_STARK : Hush now. Your father hasn't even said yes.

206
SANSA_STARK : Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.

207
CATELYN_STARK : He'd have to leave home. He'd have to leave me. And so would you.

208
SANSA_STARK : You left your home to come here. And I'd be queen someday. Please make father say yes.

209
CATELYN_STARK : Sansa ...

210
SANSA_STARK : Please, please. It's the only thing I ever wanted.

211
BENJEN_STARK : Is he dead yet?

212
JON_SNOW : Uncle Benjen!

213
BENJEN_STARK : You got bigger. Rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?

214
JON_SNOW : Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.

215
BENJEN_STARK : Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.

216
JON_SNOW : So take me with you when you go back.

217
BENJEN_STARK : Jon ...

218
JON_SNOW : Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will.

219
BENJEN_STARK : The Wall isn't going anywhere.

220
JON_SNOW : I'm ready to swear your oath.

221
BENJEN_STARK : You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.

222
JON_SNOW : I don't care about that.

223
BENJEN_STARK : You might, if you knew what it meant. I'd better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We'll talk later.

224
TYRION_LANNISTER : Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.

225
JON_SNOW : What're you doing back there?

226
TYRION_LANNISTER : Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.

227
JON_SNOW : You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?

228
TYRION_LANNISTER : My greatest accomplishment. You - you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?

229
TYRION_LANNISTER : Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.

230
JON_SNOW : Lord Eddard Stark is my father.

231
TYRION_LANNISTER : And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.

232
JON_SNOW : What the hell do you know about being a bastard?

233
TYRION_LANNISTER : All dwarves are bastards in their fathers' eyes.

234
BENJEN_STARK : You at a feast -- It's like a bear in a trap.

235
EDDARD_STARK : The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?

236
BENJEN_STARK : Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger.

237
EDDARD_STARK : He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends.

238
BENJEN_STARK : The two he was with are still missing.

239
EDDARD_STARK : A wildling ambush.

240
BENJEN_STARK : Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming.

241
EDDARD_STARK : Winter is coming.

242
ROBB_STARK : Uncle Benjen.

243
BENJEN_STARK : Robb boy. How are you?

244
ROBB_STARK : I'm good.

245
CATELYN_STARK : Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace?

246
CERSEI_LANNISTER : Yes. Lovely country.

247
CATELYN_STARK : I'm sure it's very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.

248
CERSEI_LANNISTER : Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?

249
SANSA_STARK : Thirteen, Your Grace.

250
CERSEI_LANNISTER : You're tall. Still growing?

251
SANSA_STARK : I think so, Your Grace.

252
CERSEI_LANNISTER : And have you bled yet?

253
SANSA_STARK : No, Your Grace.

254
CERSEI_LANNISTER : And your dress. Did you make it?

255
CERSEI_LANNISTER : Such talent. You must make something for me.

256
CERSEI_LANNISTER : I hear we might share a grandchild someday.

257
CATELYN_STARK : I hear the same.

258
CERSEI_LANNISTER : Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.

259
EDDARD_STARK : Your pardon.

260
JAIME_LANNISTER : I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it's true.

261
EDDARD_STARK : Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.

262
JAIME_LANNISTER : I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale.

263
EDDARD_STARK : I don't fight in tournaments.

264
JAIME_LANNISTER : No? Getting a little old for it?

265
EDDARD_STARK : I don't fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don't want him to know what I can do.

266
JAIME_LANNISTER : Well said.

267
SANSA_STARK : Arya!

268
ROBB_STARK : Time for bed.

269
EDDARD_STARK : I'm a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat's nest they call a capital.

270
CATELYN_STARK : I won't let him take you.

271
EDDARD_STARK : The king takes what he wants. That's why he's king.

272
CATELYN_STARK : I'll say, 'Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.'

273
EDDARD_STARK : How did he get so fat?

274
CATELYN_STARK : He only stops eating when it's time for a drink.

275
GUARD : It's Maester Luwin, my lord.

276
EDDARD_STARK : Send him in.

277
MAESTER_LUWIN : Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister.

278
EDDARD_STARK : Stay.

279
CATELYN_STARK : This was sent from the Eyrie. What's she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn't been back there since her wedding.

280
EDDARD_STARK : What news?

281
CATELYN_STARK : She's fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger.

282
EDDARD_STARK : She's fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn't know what she's saying.

283
CATELYN_STARK : Lysa's head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son's life, if she wasn't certain her husband was murdered?

284
MAESTER_LUWIN : If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?

285
CATELYN_STARK : They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job.

286
MAESTER_LUWIN : The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark's help. He's the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord.

287
CATELYN_STARK : He spent half his life fighting Robert's wars. He owes him nothing. Your father and brother rode south once on a king's demand.

288

316
EDDARD_STARK : I hope I'll serve you well.

317
